# The Game Of Life

This is a personal project I did in my spare time.
The Game of Life, also known as "Life", is a cellular automaton.

I invite you to:
- Run TheGameOfLife/cmake-build-debug/TheGameOfLife.exe
- Initialize a grid (of size 50 for example)
- Choose the number of loops (100 for example)
- Test the following cell coordinate settings:
    - x: 21 y: 21
    - x: 22 y: 21
    - x: 22 y: 22
    - x: 23 y: 22
    - x: 22 y: 23
- or
    - x: 21 y: 21
    - x: 22 y: 21
    - x: 23 y: 21
    - x: 23 y: 22
    - x: 23 y: 23
    - x: 22 y: 23
    - x: 21 y: 23

Have fun testing your own cell paterns and watch them evolve!
